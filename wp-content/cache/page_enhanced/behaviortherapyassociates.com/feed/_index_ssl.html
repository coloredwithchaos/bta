				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behavior Therapy Associates is pleased to announced we will be presenting at this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.autismnj.org/education-training/annual-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autism NJ Conference</a> in Atlantic City, NJ on October 18th &amp; 19th. If you will be attending the conference this year, we invite you to join our clinicians as they present on several key topics throughout the conference. In addition to our seminars, Behavior Therapy Associates clinicians will be available on the exhibit floor for questions and additional information. Please stop by to say hello!</p>
<h2>Presenter: Michael Selbst, Ph.D., BCBA-D</h2>
<h3>B18 &#8211; Self-Regulation &amp; Problem-Solving: Critical Skills for Success</h3>
<p>Individuals with ASD are commonly presented with situations where their ability to demonstrate emotional and behavioral control has significant consequences to the individual, peers, school community, and family. The individual and adults need to be prepared with concrete strategies to quickly and effectively engage in problem-solving when thing don’t go as planned. Dr. Selbst will provide user-friendly evidence-based strategies to foster self-regulation and problem-solving, including systematic steps from the POWER-Solving® curriculum (participants do not have to use this curriculum to benefit from this workshop). Participants will design their own “ready position” steps corresponding to challenging situations that their children/students experience.</p>
<h3>C26 &#8211; ACT Matrix: Manage Stress and Live Life Fully</h3>
<p>We all want to live life fully and help our children/students do the same; however, we often get in our own way through unwanted thoughts and feelings as well as maladaptive behaviors. This workshop will utilize evidence-based approaches based upon Acceptance and Commitment Therapy/Training (ACT) to teach participants how to use the ACT Matrix. The aim of ACT is to help individuals live a meaningful life, being willing to accept unpleasant inner experiences, while taking action toward a chosen direction. Parents and professionals may apply these steps for their own self-care or for learners with ASD whose cognitive and language abilities fall at least within the low average range.</p>
<h2>Presenter: Debra Salzman, Ph.D.</h2>
<h3>D33 &#8211; Anxiety and High-Functioning Autism</h3>
<p>Individuals with high-functioning autism often struggle with significant anxiety and fears. These symptoms can greatly impact their learning and home environments and can lead to disruptive behaviors and school avoidance. Participants will learn the symptoms of anxiety and strategies to mitigate them when both an anxiety disorder and high-functioning autism are present. Learning about the mechanisms that maintain the anxiety is the first step in managing it. Separation Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Specific Phobia, and Panic Disorder will be discussed.</p>
<h3>E43 &#8211; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and High-Functioning Autism</h3>
<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a common co-occurring psychiatric disorder among individuals with high-functioning autism. It is marked by intrusive or unwanted thoughts or images which result in ritualistic behaviors and routines in an attempt to alleviate distress. This workshop will highlight the symptoms of OCD and describe evidence-based behavioral treatments for helping youth with OCD and HFA. Challenges to treating OCD among youth with HFA will be outlined along with strategies for overcoming them.</p>
<h2>Presenter: Rory Panter, Psy.D.</h2>
<h3>F56 &#8211; Social Skills Training Using Evidence-Based Practices</h3>
<p>Social Skills/Social Emotional Learning is critical for individuals of all ages and functioning levels in areas such as interpersonal relationships, school performance, employment, independent living, self-esteem, emotional regulation, behavior control, and independent critical thinking. Participants will learn evidence-based, practical strategies to identify and target socially significant skills for successful social skills development. This includes assessment, identifying specific objectives, criterion for mastery, and ABA approaches to develop skills such as direct instruction, individualized programming, small-group, natural environment teaching, monitoring progress, fostering generalization across environments, parent training and collaboration, and peer modeling.</p>

<h2>Scotch Plains Highlights</h2>
<p>Written by: Rory Panter</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year at HI-STEP Scotch Plains, we have a week dedicated specifically to helping others. Our goal is to help our students develop their own sense of empathy while assisting others in the community. Throughout the week, we discussed the idea of “charity” and why it is important to give back to the community to assist those who are in need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of our Charity Week, we held a Walk-A-Thon to raise money for The Seeing Eye, which is a local organization based out of Morristown, New Jersey. The Seeing Eye is a philanthropic organization whose mission is to enhance the independence, dignity, and self-confidence of blind people through the use of Seeing Eye</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">®</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dogs. Family and friends pledged money for HI-STEP students and staff to participate in the Walk-A-Thon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were honored to have Don MacGowan (Volunteer Program Coordinator) and Marty Nusbaum (Volunteer) visit us at HI-STEP Scotch Plains with two adorable puppies (Journey and Friday). Don spoke to us about the importance of having trained guide dogs to assist blind individuals and explained to us the training process. Don, Marty, Journey, and Friday even joined us for our walk. Not only was the day informative and fun, but HI-STEP Scotch Plains proudly raised $1,000, which will be used to help sponsor a future Seeing Eye dog!</span></p>

<h2>Pennington Highlights</h2>
<p>Written by: Rebecca Schulman</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the students at HI-STEP Pennington were POWER-ed Up with Kindness! The students learned about respect, friendship, and caring for others during daily group activities. Each day students participated in activities that promote friendship and kindness among themselves and the community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of our week of kindness, we collected and created materials for the charity: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lala and Mimi’s Pajama Project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During the week, the students made blankets and pillow cases for other children in need. In addition, we collected donations of pajamas. Our kindness week culminated with a visit from Lala and Mimi (and their twin brothers and mother) to talk to us about how and why they started Lala and Mimi’s Pajama Project when they were just in fourth grade. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lala &amp; Mimi&#8217;s Pajama Project aims to provide basic bedtime comfort for all children in NJ by giving new pajamas to children ages newborn to 18. They talked about the ripple effect of kindness, which the students at HI-STEP had been learning about and demonstrating all week! We are so proud that our families and staff of HI-STEP Pennington were able to donate three boxes full of pajamas!</span></p>

<h2>Marlton Highlights</h2>
<p>Written by: Amy Golden</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At HI-STEP in Marlton, we kicked off our Kindness Challenge by having students make booklets to keep track of kind and thoughtful activities they participated in throughout the week.  They worked hard to pay kindness forward!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a group, HI-STEP staff and students decided to take on two charity projects. Our social skills lessons emphasized empathy and perspective taking, so we promoted helping others in need.  Students collected gently used clothing and books to donate to other children and also made cards for a special girl who is facing significant health challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some highlights of the week included creative arts activities that focused on our theme for the week. Students made ‘sweet statements’ lollipops out of Model Magic.  They were asked to think of positive self-statements to practice kindness to themselves, using “I am” and “I can” statements, and they wrote these on the lollipops. We also made, “Gifts of Kindness.”  Each student got a gift bag, and we filled these bags with compliments. Students took turns writing out compliments for each other and also shared them in the gift bags. Additionally, we worked on creating kindness rocks, painted rocks displaying positive statements.  Once finished, we placed these in the school garden for others to find. This idea was inspired by the “kindness rocks project” (</span><a href="http://thekindnessrocksproject.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://thekindnessrocksproject.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our students participated in spirit days to celebrate our theme by dressing in a variety of fun styles.  We dreamt of kindness by wearing pajamas, let kindness shine in bright clothes, teamed up for kindness in favorite team shirts, and more.  The students were full of spirit and reminded of our shared goals.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><b>The Autism-OCD Connection</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have an increased risk of experiencing a number of anxiety disorders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In particular, OCD and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder have a high comorbidity (37% or higher). Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is diagnosed by the presence of obsessions (unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images or urges) that caused significant discomfort and/or compulsions (behaviors) that the person feels driven to do to decrease their discomfort and/or get rid of the obsession.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to meet the criteria for OCD, the obsessions and/or compulsions need to be time consuming or cause marked interference in the person’s life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Common obsessions include thoughts of contamination or getting sick, fear of causing harm, fear of losing control, fear of making the wrong decision, doubting whether the person did something (brought my books home, turned out the light), and worry over things being in the right place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Common compulsions include handwashing, checking, seeking reassurance from parents and teachers, re-reading, erasing and re-writing, doing things a certain number of times, saving everything, excessive showering and arranging things.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Impact of OCD on the Child and Family </b></h2>
<p class="p1">These behaviors can lead to significant interference in a child’s and family’s life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At times, parents become prisoners to their child’s OCD symptoms, doing everything they can to help their child avoid being anxious and avoid a tantrum or meltdown. Parents and caregivers are often struggling to manage other challenging behaviors, so the addition of comorbid OCD creates ever-increasing challenges. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents, caregivers and teachers do what comes naturally, which is to provide reassurance and structure the child’s day to avoid the OCD triggers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, reassurance and avoidance only serve to maintain the OCD and leads to increasing symptoms over time.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Breaking the Cycle of OCD</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Treatment aimed at reducing OCD symptoms requires just the opposite, facing your feared scenarios and preventing oneself from ritualizing, breaking the connection between the obsession and compulsion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This treatment is called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is done step by step by creating a hierarchy of feared scenarios and difficult situations explaining what needs to be done (by both the parent and child) at each step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, this requires motivation on the part of the child.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore, ERP will have the best success among those with high functioning autism. A child with higher cognitive skills will have more understanding of the essential features needed for ERP. The child is agreeing to begin a treatment that, in the short-term, will increase his/her anxiety knowing that eventually, the anxiety (and OCD) will decrease.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Investing anxiety in the short-term for a life free of ritualizing and no longer being a prisoner to the OCD is a hard task even for children and adults without an ASD diagnosis to agree to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The challenge becomes helping the child with a comorbid ASD diagnosis understand the benefits of treatment and increasing their motivation to “fight the OCD monster.”</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Challenges to Treatment </b></h2>
<p class="p1">There are many challenges to treatment for children with a comorbid ASD and OCD diagnosis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Motivation is probably one of the hardest to address.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time spent outlining the ways in which OCD interferes in the child’s life and the feelings of helplessness to fight “the bully” of OCD can help to improve motivation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents and caregivers may need to stop “giving in” to the OCD as well in order for the child to feel motivated to work on the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents who change their own clothes when they walk into the house to help a child with contamination fears are not providing an environment for the child to see the need for change.</p>
<p class="p1">Knowing that there may be reduced motivation, treatment for individuals with a co-occurring diagnosis may need to move at a slower pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time spent on making sure the child fully understands the reasons why we are “facing the monster” helps to improve motivation Providing smaller steps for change, allowing the child to have more control in the pace of the treatment may also increase motivation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p1">Exposure and Response Prevention for individuals with a comorbid diagnosis with high functioning autism presents unique challenges but ones that can be overcome. Treatment is highly effective and can create meaningful change in the child’s and family’s life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Understanding OCD and the mechanisms that maintain the OCD are the first steps towards change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the numbers of children identified as having an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have increased in recent years, obtaining a comprehensive Autism Spectrum Disorder evaluation and accurate diagnosis has become even more critical. Embarking on the assessment process can seem overwhelming for parents of a child who is experiencing significant developmental delays, including social, behavioral, and communication difficulties. It is important to understand the purpose of obtaining an accurate assessment and the benefits that can result from participating in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network (</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, approximately 1 in every 68 children in the United States has been identified as having an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Individuals are diagnosed with an ASD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and the diagnosis is 4.5 times more common in boys than girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he importance of early identification and treatment of individuals with ASD has been well established. Due to the increase in prevalence and advances in diagnostic measures, more children are being diagnosed at earlier ages. The research shows that symptoms of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger, and by age two a diagnosis by an experienced professional can be considered very reliable. Screening, evaluating, and diagnosing children with ASD as early as possible is important to ensure that these children have access to the services and supports they need. It is also important to consider periodic updated evaluations for educational and treatment planning.</span></p>
<h2><b>What are some of the reasons to pursue an Autism Spectrum Disorder evaluation?</b></h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2><b>What should you know if you are considering an Autism Spectrum Disorder evaluation for your child?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A comprehensive autism spectrum evaluation should include at least the following:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developmental history</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functional observations (school, home, office, and/or community)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct interaction with the child</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parent interview</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher interview (or other care provider) and interview with other pertinent staff members</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completion of developmental questionnaires</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprehensive evaluation of the child’s functioning in the areas of social interaction, communication, behavior, emotional, cognitive, academic, sensory and adaptive behavior. Depending upon the child’s age, levels of functioning, and specific goals of the evaluation, the evaluation may or may not include formal / direct assessment in all of these areas.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evaluation results should be summarized in a typed report, which includes specific and meaningful recommendations. There should be a follow up, face-to-face, feedback session with the parents, allowing sufficient opportunity for questions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evaluation should be performed by an experienced and knowledgeable professional who has attained the necessary license and/or certification to administer the evaluation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What is the ADOS-2 and what role does it play in the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder evaluation?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition is a semi-structured, standardized assessment of communication, social interaction, play, and restrictive and repetitive behaviors.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADOS-2 is considered the “gold standard” observational assessment for diagnosing ASD.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be used with individuals from 1 year old through adulthood with a wide range of developmental and language levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information obtained using this assessment measure can guide diagnosis, intervention, treatment planning, and educational placement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADOS-2 is one component of a full diagnostic evaluation for ASD.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADOS-2 should be used by professionals who have education, training, and experience in the use of individually administered test batteries, clinical interviewing, and experience in the treatment of ASD and other developmental disabilities. In addition, professionals must complete specific clinical training in administration, scoring, and interpretation of the ADOS-2.</span></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Social and Emotional Learning?</h2>
<p>Social and emotional learning is a complex process in which children and adults acquire and utilize skills that are necessary to interact with oneself and others in a positive manner. Core competencies for individuals to learn include managing one’s emotions, setting and achieving positive life goals, establishing and maintaining positive interpersonal relationships, feeling and showing empathy for others, and making responsible decisions (<a href="https://casel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning</span></a>, 2010). These critical abilities are necessary for maintaining successful relationships with others, gaining meaningful employment, navigating daily life skills, and problem-solving issues that arise in life, particularly as one moves toward adulthood and greater independence. Due to the primary characteristics of autism, individuals on the spectrum tend to fall short in these crucial skills if not provided access to systematic, intensive supports to address these areas of need.</p>
<h2>Social and Emotional Learning Can Positively Impact a Child&#8217;s Adult Life</h2>
<p><a href="http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302630" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A recent study (Jones, et al., 2015) in the American Journal of Public Health</span></a> documented the relationship between the social and emotional skills of kindergarten students and future wellness in 25-year-olds. Interestingly, this study demonstrated that there were statistically significant associations among measured social and emotional skills in kindergarten and critical young adult outcomes. The authors identified these outcomes across many domains that impact one’s social and emotional well-being, including education, employment, criminal activity, substance use, and mental health. Understanding this significant association is important for early identification and intervention to provide social and emotional learning when children are young and to continue these supports throughout the school years.</p>
<h2>Early Intervention is Key To Success</h2>
<p>A primary emphasis of a student’s educational programming should be on the development of social skills to succeed in life. Recognizing this need early on is especially important for individuals with autism. Due to the complexities of developing comprehensive programming to address the myriad of potential core deficits, as well as the likelihood of substantial lessening of services as the student ages out of the school system, identification of social and emotional goals should be a priority throughout formal schooling and needs to continue through adulthood. While many individuals whose development is typical will acquire and demonstrate prosocial skills as a result of social modeling, those on the autism spectrum require direct and sustained intervention, planned procedures to foster generalization, and monitoring of their progress.</p>
<h2>Social and Emotional Assessment</h2>
<p>Initial and ongoing efforts should be made to identify an individual’s strengths and areas of needed development through assessment of social and emotional skills. There are various measures that can assist, such as the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System &#8211; Third Edition (Harrison &amp; Oakland, 2015), which can be administered on behalf of individuals of all ages and helps to assess the capability of the individual to live independently as an adult. Similarly, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales &#8211; Third Edition (Sparrow, et al., 2016) can be used across the lifespan to assist with program planning and progress monitoring. Additionally, <a href="https://partingtonbehavioranalysts.com/products/afls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Assessment of Functional Living Skills</span></a> (Partington &amp; Mueller, 2012) provides a detailed assessment of practical life skills to maximize independence. Each of these tools can be used to determine the individual’s baseline skills so that proper goal selection and educational planning can take place most efficiently.</p>
<h2>Discuss, Demonstrate, Do</h2>
<p>Many social and emotional skills can be taught through the 3-D approach of “discuss, demonstrate, do” (Asher, et al., 2010). Within the discussion step, individuals are taught the rationale for learning the skill and the steps involved. An example of this is teaching the student why to initiate a text message and how they can ask a friend for help. The second step involves the instructor or a peer model demonstrating the skill while the student watches. Last, the student participates in the skill by doing it while receiving coaching and feedback. Role-play may continue until the learner demonstrates proficiency with the skill, and then additional practice opportunities should be planned with support. Such support oftentimes is provided via a job coach or supervisor, trained instructional assistant, or parent/guardian.</p>
<h2>Assessing Performance Deficits</h2>
<p>It is also important to consider whether the individual possesses the knowledge of the skill and can perform it under certain circumstances but not others. In this case, the student may have deficits in performance or generalization. Performance deficits may be seen when the individual can discuss the skill, list what to do or demonstrate it in practice, but he or she does not consistently exhibit the skill when needed. The individual exhibiting skills only in certain controlled situations or only with familiar people may have difficulty generalizing acquired skills and therefore may need additional practice opportunities in novel settings with coaching. Furthermore, once the skill has been mastered and generalized, fluency (i.e., the rate and accuracy in which the skill is demonstrated) should be addressed to ensure that the learner can perform the skill quickly enough to use it effectively. Helping the individual to master the skill with automaticity is critical so that they can integrate the skill into their everyday life and navigate an infinite number of situations they may encounter.</p>
<p>Thus, while the 3-D approach for teaching skills provides a simple method for instruction, individuals may need significant supports to effectively use these skills in the natural environment. Utilizing evidence-based strategies to develop these skills will maximize the likelihood of skill acquisition, performance, and generalization (Wong, et al., 2013). These include, but are not limited to, modeling, reinforcement, peer-mediated instruction, social narratives, task analysis, video modeling, visual supports, etc.</p>
<h2>How Adults Can Support Children</h2>
<p>Real life practice is crucial for longterm success and increasing levels of independence. The adults providing support need to carefully and systematically plan to fade these same supports (e.g., prompts, reinforcement procedures) as appropriate. Thus, there is a fundamental difference between shadowing and monitoring progress compared to hovering. Individuals with autism need guidance to identify what is important to them (e.g., living independently, socializing with peers, leisure activities), to set short- and long-term goals that correspond to these (e.g., obtaining and maintaining employment, using public transportation, participating in clubs), and developing the associated skills to successfully move toward these valued paths. For many individuals on the autism spectrum, much adult support is necessary to help identify these areas. Yet, with a focus on the future, a commitment to present actions, and a well-developed plan, the transition (and journey) to and through adulthood may be more successful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sun is setting and all you can think about is “Not another bedtime!” The yelling and crying last night was enough to last a week. Just when you thought you were in the clear, you hear calls from your child’s bedroom after he wakes up and cannot fall back to sleep. Bedtime can be a stressful time for many parents, as children resist getting ready for bed and have difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or getting enough sleep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this sounds all too familiar to you, you are not alone. In fact, 10-50% of young children whose development is typical and 50-80% of youth with developmental disabilities have sleep problems. Sleep problems not only cause frustration and discord among caregivers, but they are also associated with higher levels of severe problem behavior (e.g., tantrums, aggression, and self-injury), stereotypy, and noncompliance. Sleep problems may also interfere with learning, and persistent sleep problems in childhood are associated with childhood and adult obesity, adolescent behavioral and emotional problems, anxiety in adulthood, and sleep problems through adulthood. However, the good news is that sleep problems can be considered a skill deficit and all children can learn to be better sleepers with the use of behavior therapy, rather than medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, there is no FDA approval for any pediatric sleep medication, there is no medication labeled for pediatric insomnia, and research does not show evidence of consistent efficacy for pharmacological interventions. Although medication may help your child fall asleep quicker, it often leads to a greater amount of night awakenings. Therefore, behavior therapy is a more effective, long-term solution for sleep problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to addressing sleep problems is assessing the specific sleep difficulties experienced by your child and identifying goals for your child’s sleep. “Good sleep” is often characterized by falling asleep quickly, staying asleep throughout the night, waking up without much trouble each morning, and not feeling drowsy during the day. Common sleep problems include delayed sleep onset, which can include sleep-interfering behavior (e.g., crying, calling out, playing, stereotypy, talking to oneself, etc.), night or early awakenings, short sleep duration, and phase shifts (i.e., sleeping at wrong times thus conflicting with daily routines). Children’s sleep problems are assessed using an open-ended interview to identify the personal factors influencing sleep problems. This information is then combined with general information about common factors that influence good sleep and sleep problems in order to develop treatments in collaboration with parents based on the controlling variables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individualized and comprehensive treatment consists of five steps: 1) Develop ideal sleep schedule, 2) Create structured nighttime routine, 3) Optimize bedroom conditions, 4) Develop regular sleep dependencies, and 5) Address sleep interfering behavior (Jin, Hanley, &amp; Beaulieu, 2013). When creating a sleep schedule, it is essential to consider age-appropriate sleep amounts and recent sleep history. Additionally, it is important to help your child develop sleep dependencies on things that are routinely and easily present throughout the night. Last, there must be a clear discrepancy between what is available during the day versus at night to ensure good sleep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing your child’s sleep problems may seem daunting. However, sleep difficulties typically persist without treatment. Isn’t it time that everyone got a good night’s sleep? </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, let’s revisit the question presented at the beginning. Recall the exasperated parent asking, “Why can’t you just do what I told you to do?” On the surface, it appears that the difference lies between hearing and listening. Hearing involves the registration of sound waves through the eardrum which stimulates particular parts of the brain. Listening involves that step, but goes a bit further. Listening involves understanding or comprehension, this means knowing what was said, and to go a bit further, responding to what was said in a way that the speaker intended. Part of listening, whether we like it or not, involves both understanding and motivation. Would it be sufficient for understanding without some response to follow? How would we know that the person, or in this case, the child, has understood what we said? What about motivation to listen? Motivators/reinforcers are idiosyncratic to the individual. Although we would like our parental approval to be sufficient to motivate, sometimes it’s just not enough depending on the request. If we turn our focus back to what needs to improve, one sees that in order to complete the task requested, some level of self-awareness is needed (i.e., answering the question: do I understand the request and am I on track with complying with the request), attention to the instruction and working memory to verbally remind oneself of what to do, inhibition and impulse control (think delayed gratification), and planning (i.e., the steps the child follows to complete the steps). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When one looks at the list of skills needed to complete a simple task, it is a wonder that anything gets done! However, supports can be provided externally by the environment (of which parents are a part) while behavioral skills are acquired, practiced, generalized, and maintained across many different circumstances. What is to be done? First, secure attention; second, make sure the child understands what is being asked; third, focus on consequences (i.e., what happens when you follow my directions?), and reinforce immediately once successful (i.e., pay attention to what happens when the child correctly executes the instruction).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADHD journey can be arduous at times. In those moments, take a deep breath, reflect on what has worked in the past to help change behavior, connect to what kind of parent you want to be for your child, and follow through. When in doubt, you may find that seeking additional strategies from a trained professional, linking to an organization such as CHAAD, and/or joining a local community parent support group can help guide you along the path.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help move from abstract concepts to skills, let’s look at impulsivity. Impulsivity can be looked at as a deficit in inhibition and impulse control, otherwise known as delayed gratification. Delayed gratification is waiting for a larger or higher quality reward in lieu of a lower quality, smaller reward. Identifying delayed gratification brings about behavior that can be targeted for intervention in context. Imagine what happens when a parent picks up a ringing telephone, and a child is playing with toys. Suddenly, the parent’s attention and their answers to previously unimportant questions become a child’s top priority. Children do lots of creative things to get a parent’s attention: take risks (i.e., climb the counters), pester (pull at a parent’s leg or clothing), and attempt to have parents answer questions through nonverbal means (just nod your head like this if I can have a special snack right now).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we examine impulsivity as a behavior rather than an innate quality, we can pinpoint antecedents (what happens before behavior occurs) and consequences (what happens after behavior) that may contribute to impulsivity and identify environmental modifications that we can try. For instance, diverted parental attention from the phone call and consequent actions such as a parent saying “Go play with your toys,” “Can’t you see I’m on the phone right now?” or “If you don’t be quiet and stop, you’re going to your room!” may be unintendedly maintaining the behavioral issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some strategies for handling impulsivity may be to work on the issue outside of when it occurs. For example, the parent, not under duress of attending to the phone call and the child, may question the child on what they can do when on the phone. Perhaps, the parent may even set aside preferred toys for the child that may only be used when the parent is on the phone. The parent may teach the child that only in an emergency can they be interrupted on the phone and explain types of emergency situations. Other antecedent strategies may include reviewing what happens if the child can wait or do something else that is appropriate when the parent is busy and the consequences the child may receive if no pestering occurs. Consequence-based strategies may include reinforcing alternative/other behavior than inappropriate behavior with a parent providing attention once the phone call ends by playing with the child with a preferred activity for a couple of minutes. Additionally, when on the phone, the parent ignores the child’s requests and perhaps walks away from the child to another location while on the phone. Obviously, practice for the above should take place frequently and in different situations. This may be done by role-playing situations and making it a game such as planning how this would look when in the car or at the store. Remember one cannot mistake that the behavior of waiting would transfer to other non-phone related situations. Preparation, providing opportunities for practice, having a plan of action, and consistency are keys to success when handling delayed gratification problems.</span></p>
<p><b>Next time, we’ll conclude our discussion of ADHD by revisiting the initial scenario and outline environmental strategies to promote success.</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, ADHD symptoms suggest difficulties with executive functioning, and may highlight that ADHD is partially a disorder of executive functioning. Executive functioning consists of three areas: working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working memory is where information is manipulated or transformed in conscious awareness. Working memory is utilized if you are recalling a mental grocery list and are going around the store picking up items, and then visualizing crossing them off. Alternatively, working memory is also involved if you asked your child to complete three tasks: they have to plan and prioritize the tasks, execute actions to complete the task, and mentally cross those tasks off the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cognitive flexibility is using what has been learned differently as the situation requires, as opposed to rigidly adhering to rules or previous ways of doing things. An adult example would be having to detour from a previously established driving route home. A child example would be adapting to changing afternoon plans when a sibling falls ill and must be taken to the doctor’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, inhibitory control is resisting urges to act without thinking. For adults, this may be choosing to ignore a text on the phone while driving. For children, this can involve using words instead of aggression (biting, hitting, kicking) when disagreements arise with peers, or raising one’s hand as compared with shouting out to answer a teacher’s question in class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three key areas mediate self-regulation and attention. However, rather than talk about them as innate abilities (i.e., immutable, unchangeable characteristics of a child), executive functioning may be more helpfully thought of as a set of skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As identified by Dr. Adel C. Najdowski (2017), behavior-based executive functioning treatment targets the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-awareness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhibition and impulse control</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attention</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working memory</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional self-regulation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the face of it, some of these areas look like abstract concepts. However, they may be reframed as occasionally discrete and at times coordinated set of overlapping skills used to successfully navigate one’s environment (i.e., school, social situations, work, community, etc.). When acquiring new skills, children and adults need help in generalizing them across multiple situations. The idea of teaching once and it will be used across environments does not hold. Therefore, a child who learned how to plan one day of afternoon activities cannot be assumed to be able to do this for morning activities, the next day, or for the entire week. The skills need to be practiced often, at different times, and many different situations to “stick.” A fancy, more technical name for this is “multiple exemplar training” or training to a variety of examples.</span></p>
<p><b>By looking at these targets as skills, we can begin to reframe characteristics of ADHD to promote skill-based treatments, and this will be our focus next time</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) most recent survey data in 2011, there were 8.8% of children ages 4 to 17 diagnosed with ADHD, which was an increase from 2007, with 7.2% of children diagnosed with ADHD. Males are more frequently diagnosed with ADHD in both children and adults compared to females: roughly at a 2:1 ratio for children and 1.6:1 for adults (DSM-5, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization, Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), in conjunction with the CDC, reported on coexisting conditions diagnosed along with ADHD. Approximately 40% of individuals diagnosed with ADHD are also diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), 14% of children meet criteria depression, 30% for anxiety, 50% for a learning disorder, and 60% to 80% of individuals diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome also meet criteria for ADHD. Given the high occurrence of co-existing conditions, it is clear that both comprehensive evaluations and multiple component treatment programs are the foundation for intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thaper, Cooper, Jefferies, and Stergiakouli (2012) identified common risk factors for ADHD. It should be noted that no one single factor is responsible for ADHD presentation; it is a combination of genetic and environmental interplay that affects symptomology. Higher ADHD rates are found with parents or siblings diagnosed with ADHD, mothers who smoke, use alcohol, drugs, or have elevated stress/anxiety during pregnancy. Infants who are delivered prematurely and/or have a low birth weight, have been exposed to toxins (pesticides, lead, PCBs), and have experienced extreme deprivation are at a greater risk. Although low parental education, social class, poverty, bullying, negative parenting, and family discord are associated with ADHD, there has not been a causal link identified for such factors. The authors also noted that sugar, artificial food colorings, zinc, iron, magnesium, or omega-3 fatty acids have not be implicated in ADHD symptoms. However, it was indicated that this does not mean that dietary changes may not help to modify ADHD symptoms. There are not enough rigorous, scientific studies at this point to suggest that dietary changes may ameliorate ADHD symptoms.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prognosis for untreated ADHD related symptoms is mixed. Beiderman and colleagues (2012) found that males, participating in a 16-year follow-up study, experienced psychosocial, educational, and neurophysiological functioning impartments more frequently when compared to their non-ADHD diagnosed counterparts. For females participating in an 11-year follow-up study, Bierdman and colleagues (2010) found increased risks of antisocial disorders, depression, and anxiety as compared to their non-ADHD diagnosed counterparts. Given this information, the rule of thumb is earlier the better when it comes to treatment, but there is never a point where interventions should not be attempted. Additionally, it also suggests that individuals diagnosed with ADHD may need different types of interventions throughout the lifespan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When interventions are attempted initially, a medication-based intervention appears to be first. The CDC indicated that of those diagnosed with ADHD, 69% in 2011 were receiving pharmacological based treatments. It is not clear if behavioral treatments were attempted first, however, due to potential negative side effects of medication treatment, a behavior-based treatment should be the first line of intervention as this is less physiological intrusive, although it is often more effortful and time-consuming at least initially. However, by learning skills in a supportive environment, the child can discover what works for them in helping them succeed in school and home.</span></p>
<p><b>Next time, we’ll examine a particular set of skills that tend to be a core deficit for individuals diagnosed with ADHD and some thoughts about building those skills.</b></p>
